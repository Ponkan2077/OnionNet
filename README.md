# ðŸ§  OnionNet â€“ Smart AI-Powered Irrigation for Onion Farming

**OnionNet** is an intelligent irrigation management system powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, designed specifically to optimize water use in onion farming.

The system gathers real-time environmental data â€” such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity â€” through a network of sensors and uses machine learning algorithms to predict and automate irrigation schedules with high precision.

By making data-driven decisions, OnionNet reduces water consumption, enhances crop yield, and supports climate-resilient agriculture. Farmers can monitor and control irrigation remotely via a mobile/web interface, receive smart alerts, and adjust settings based on crop stages or weather forecasts.
